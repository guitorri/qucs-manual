"""""

The losses and thus the quality factor (Q) of the component are frequency dependent: the *Mode* parameters determines the behavior of Q with frequency.

Possible choices are:

:Constant: :math:`Q(f) = Q(f_0)`
:Linear: :math:`Q(f) = Q(f_0)\cdot (f/f_0)`
:Square root: :math:`Q(f) = Q(f_0)\cdot \sqrt{f/f_0}`
